# distplay

This is the web version of distplay. By "web version" I mean "my old code before my friend Cali
updated it, just updated, and no longer requires electron". A better system for a web version of
this would probably be ideal, but there's not really any frontend difference to just using my old
code, so... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Using the Display
The web version is available at: [https://tntmatthew.github.io/distplay/distplay.html]  
And the Distance variation: [https://tntmatthew.github.io/distplay/distplay-distance.html]
  
## Display mapping
The display for the display mapped by default as:

| Button           | JS              |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| A                | buttons[0]      |
| B                | buttons[1]      |
| X                | buttons[2]      |
| Y                | buttons[3]      |
| Left Bumper      | buttons[4]      |
| Right Bumper     | buttons[5]      |
| Right Trigger    | buttons[7]      |
| Left Trigger     | buttons[6]      |
| Back/Select      | buttons[8]      |
| Forward/Start    | buttons[9]      |
| LS Click         | buttons[10]     |
| RS Click         | buttons[11]     |
| DPad Up          | buttons[12]     |
| DPad Down        | buttons[13]     |
| DPad Left        | buttons[14]     |
| DPad Right       | buttons[15]     |
| LS Horizontal    | axes[0]         |
| LS Vertical      | axes[1]         |
| RS Horizontal    | axes[2]         |
| RS Vertical      | axes[3]         |

The Distance display is set up to reflect the default bindings for the game, albeit with a right stick.
