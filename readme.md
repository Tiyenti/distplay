# distplay
![distplay](/img/distplay.png?raw=true)

A basic controller input display. Made this because I couldn't find any
Linux controller input displays. I pretty much made this only for myself,
so I made no attempt to make this universally compatible with every system
ever. It works for me, but it may not work for you - the HTML5 Gamepad API
is kind of inconsistent. It should technically "work" on any system,
but it might not work *properly*.

This input was previously exlusively designed to work with Distance, but
I decided to make it work for anything with an Xbox controller layout.

The Distance version is still available though.

## Using the Display
Because I have no idea how to package an Electron app and I'm
too lazy to learn, run the display with Electron manually:

`electron ./distplay.html`

(or `electron ./distplay-distance.html` for the Distance version)

Add a window capture source in OBS to capture the display's window, and
set the colour transparency key to black.

You can also open distplay[-distance].html in a browser and use window
capture as described above, alternatively use a BrowserCapture source in
OBS and the default style rule it injects will handle transparency for you.
  
## Display mapping
The display for the display mapped by default as:

| Button           | JS              |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| A                | buttons[0]      |
| B                | buttons[1]      |
| X                | buttons[2]      |
| Y                | buttons[3]      |
| Left Bumper      | buttons[4]      |
| Right Bumper     | buttons[5]      |
| Right Trigger    | buttons[7]      |
| Left Trigger     | buttons[6]      |
| Back/Select      | buttons[8]      |
| Forward/Start    | buttons[9]      |
| LS Click         | buttons[10]     |
| RS Click         | buttons[11]     |
| DPad Up          | buttons[12]     |
| DPad Down        | buttons[13]     |
| DPad Left        | buttons[14]     |
| DPad Right       | buttons[15]     |
| LS Horizontal    | axes[0]         |
| LS Vertical      | axes[1]         |
| RS Horizontal    | axes[2]         |
| RS Vertical      | axes[3]         |

The Distance display is set up to reflect the default bindings
for the game, albliet with a right stick.

Because the HTML5 Gamepad API is inconsistent between different
browsers and operating systems and I made no attempt to make things
universally compatible, you may need to edit the JS yourself to get
things to work properly - you'll also need to do this if your
ingame control setup differs.
